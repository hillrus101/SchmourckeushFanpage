                    <h2>Schmourckeush's Story</h2>
                    <p>Schmourckeush was born on December 25th, 2020 as a full grown Schmourck. This day will later be considered "The Day of the Schmourck". He swiftly moved to Greenville, IL to fullfill his dream of being a model. However, as he started his path he realized that his real passion lies within being an advice giver. Since then he has started his own company, Schmourckeush Co. He loves helping others and wants nothing more than to make the world a better place. He still models on the side (check out his <a href="media.html">portfolio here</a>). Due to a tragic boating accident, he lost his back right leg, which makes it very hard to stand. But that doesn't stop him from being the best Schmourck he can be.<p>
